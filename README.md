This is an api for registering minecraft skins with a specified image on their head on mojang servers. This is used by the [BungeeTabListPlus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bungeetablistplus.313/) plugin to allow the users to use custom images for the heads in the tab list.

I run an instance of this at [skinservice.codecrafter47.dyndns.eu](http://skinservice.codecrafter47.dyndns.eu/).
